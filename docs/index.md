### üß© Examples

Recursively scan the current working directory with default settings (all rules):

```shell
asist .
```

This scan produces the following output, indicating the total number of issues identified, the start and end timestamps, and the detailed findings:

```json
{
 "Count": 161,
 "Started": "2025-07-23 13:12:08.231779 +0200 CEST m=+0.000501126",
 "Ended": "2025-07-23 13:12:08.307712 +0200 CEST m=+0.076432459",
 "Result": [
  {
   "ID": "ApexClassNoSharing",
   "Name": "Apex Class No Sharing",
   "Description": "Use of Apex classes where the sharing clause is not specified may cause confusion for other developers. Always set the most restrictive sharing clause for each class.",
   "Severity": "Medium",
   "RuleCategory": "Security",
   "Occurrence": {
    "File": "/Users/shaundoyle/sandbox/product/asist/files/testData/testFile.cls",
    "Line": "Class TestFile {",
    "LineNumber": 1,
    "ColumnRange": [
     0,
     14
    ]
   }
  },
  {
   "ID": "XSSFormAction",
   "Name": "Potential XSS with formaction in JS context",
   "Description": "Use of the formaction attribute in JavaScript context may introduce an XSS issue. Consider removing it, otherwise ensure that no user input is rendered unescaped.",
   "Severity": "High",
   "RuleCategory": "Security",
   "Occurrence": {
    "File": "/Users/shaundoyle/sandbox/product/asist/integrationtests/src/aura/aura.cmp",
    "Line": "    \u003cform id=\"test\"\u003e\u003c/form\u003e\u003cbutton form=\"test\" formaction=\"javascript:alert(1)\"\u003eX\u003c/button\u003e",
    "LineNumber": 3,
    "ColumnRange": [
     47,
     70
    ]
   }
  },
  [...]
```

Scan a single file with default settings:

```shell
asist force-app/main/default/classes/MyClass.cls
```

Print the ASIST version

```shell
asist -V
```

Scan a file with your config:

```shell
asist -c ./.asist.json force-app/main/default/classes/MyClass.cls
```

Scan with a single rule:

```shell
/asist -r ApexClassNoSharing .
```

Just list enabled rules, but don't scan:

```shell
asist -l
asist -c .asist.yaml -l # Does not list rules disabled in your config
```

Run in verbose mode (for debugging):

```shell
asist -v .
```

Run in CI/CD mode (will only run rules added to `cicdrules` if this property is defined):

```shell
asist -j .
```

Run in baseline mode:

```shell
asist -b -u "https://github.com/certinia/asist.git" .
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Most of the configuration required for your project will be defined in a configuration file.

ASIST supports YAML or JSON config files.

When scanning a folder, ASIST will automatically detect either `.asist.yaml` or `.asist.json` from the top-level folder being scanned.

Configuration files can also be explicitly specified using the `-c` argument (note that this is required when scanning a single file).

Within the config file, you can:

* Enable/disable all the standard rules  
* Override certain properties of standard rules
* Exclude files or directories for all rules
* Exclude files or directories for specific rules
* Add custom regex rules
* Define rules to be run in CI/CD mode

See our [example config file](https://github.com/certinia/asist/blob/main/.asist.example.yaml) for a walkthrough of all config options.

### üîß Customizing Standard rules

Users can override certain properties of standard rules according to their needs, allowing them to customize the behavior of specific rules by:

- Disabling rules entirely: `enabled`
- Tweaking rule severity: `severity`
- Tweaking what files should be scanned: `includepattern`
- Tweaking what files should not be scanned: `excludepattern`

### ‚úçüèº Creating Custom Rules

In addition to customizing standard rules, users can also create custom rules to define their own regex pattern:

```yaml
customregexrules:
  NoDebugStatements:
    name: doNotDebug
    description: "Debug statements anticipate bugs; avoid bugs instead"
    enabled: false
    severity: Critical
    rulecategory: Security
    pattern: "System\\.debug\\("
    includepattern: "\\.cls$"
    excludepattern: "Test\\.cls$"
```

You can test this specific rule like this:


```shell
asist -c .asist.yaml -r doNotDebug <file>
```

## ‚ùå False positive management

ASIST provides the ability to mark false positives with annotations, comments, or any other places where arbitrary text can be specified.

In the example below, the `SessionIDApex` rule is ignored for the statement:

```java
// asist-ignore-begin:[SessionIDApex]
ID sid = UserInfo.getSessionID();
// asist-ignore-end
```

Various rule IDs may be comma-separated to ignore multiple rules for a particular block of code, and comments with justifications can be set after the `asist-ignore-begin` statement:

```java
// asist-ignore-begin:[SessionIDApex,InsecureCryptoAlgorithm] This code is for testing, and not part of the package
ID sid = UserInfo.getSessionID();
Blob sidBlob = Blob.valueOf(sid);
Blob hash = Crypto.generateDigest('MD5', sidBlob);
[...]
// asist-ignore-end
```

In markup languages, comments should be set in `<!-- comments -->` when possible.

In any other file types, the user must figure out the more appropriate way to insert the `asist-ignore-begin` and `asist-ignore-end` statements. Technically, it doesn't matter where you put them!

_**Note**: Nested false positive tags are not supported._

# üîÅ CI/CD mode

CI/CD mode is enabled using the `-j` flag:

```shell
asist -j .
```

In this mode, by default, all enabled runs will be run if `cicdrules` property is not defined, but if the `cicdrules` config property contains any rule IDs, only these will be run. And, if `cicdrules` is defined but is blank (no rule is mentioned under this property), then no rules will be executed.

```yaml
cicdrules: 
  - "XSSLabel"
  - "XSSMergeField"
```

This allows developers to add a subset of the overall ruleset to ASIST to their CI/CD pipelines, and gradually add more rules to CI/CD as they start clearing out findings for other rules. This prevents any issues for rules defined in `cicdrules` from creeping back into the codebase.

### üìä Baseline scans

This mode is intended for SecOps teams to create benchmarks across multiple projects and measure the adoption of ASIST.

Some overrides in config, such as severity, will be ignored to normalize data for apples-to-apples comparison between different code bases, and false positive findings will be included in the output.

Baseline mode is enabled by means of the `-b` flag.

It's also recommended to specify a repository URL with the `-u` flag:

```shell
asist -b -u "git@github.com:certinia/asist.git" .
```

This command will output a JSON like this (when formatted):

```json
[
	{
		"RepositoryName": "certinia/asist",
		"RepositoryURL": "git@github.com:certinia/asist.git",
		"RecordType": "Finding",
		"Content": {
			"FindingID": "b17fe249915712219aca7e",
			"IsCustom": false,
			"IsFalsePositive": true,
			"RuleID": "LwcNonStandardPositioning",
			"Severity": "Medium",
			"RuleCategory": "Security"
		}
	},
	{
		"RepositoryName": "certinia/asist",
		"RepositoryURL": "git@github.com:certinia/asist.git",
		"RecordType": "Finding",
		"Content": {
			"FindingID": "3a2861bee641864816b86d",
			"IsCustom": false,
			"IsFalsePositive": true,
			"RuleID": "LwcNonStandardPositioning",
			"Severity": "Medium",
			"RuleCategory": "Security"
		}
	}
]
```

A few differences can be observed compared to regular scans:

- Most of the "human-friendly" information is missing (e.g., the code location of the finding, the finding description, etc.)
- The repository name and URL will be included so that metrics systems can use this as a dimension for filtering.
- Each issue is assigned a `FindingID`, which is effectively a hash that uniquely identifies the finding based on the rule, the finding location, and if it's a false positive or not.
- A few more properties are added, such as if the rule is custom, or if the finding is marked as false positive or not.


### ü´£ .gitignore and .forceignore files

By default, ASIST will ignore files and folders defined inside .gitignore and .forceignore. If you don't want ASIST to respect .gitignore and .forceignore, you can use the following properties in the config file:

- **dontgitignore**
- **dontforceignore**

### ‚çà Exit Codes

| Exit code | Exit Reason                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | ASIST executed successfully with no findings             |
| 1         | ASIST executed successfully with findings                |
| 3         | ASIST failed due to internal error (file a bug report!)  |
| 4         | ASIST failed due to user error (review input and config) |

# üß© VS Code Extension

Using the VSCode extension is by far the easiest way to get started with ASIST.
When a file is opened or saved, ASIST will scan it to identify vulnerabilities.

Just like a linter, once the scan is complete, ASIST will annotate your code with the findings and the rule description. Findings can also be found in the "Problems" tab.

Workspace scans are also supported, making it easy to run ASIST on an entire project and address all your issues on the fly!

## üì¶ Installation

The extension is available on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=financialforce.asist).

## ‚ö° Extension commands

ASIST commands can be run in VSCode by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `ASIST` to get the list of available commands.
Note that some commands will print results to the "Output" tab in VSCode (select `ASIST` in the channel dropdown).

![ASIST Extension commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certinia/asist/main/extension/image-1.png)

- **Run on file:** Runs a scan on the current opened file.
- **Run on workspace:** Runs a scan on the current project workspace.
- **List enabled rules:** Outputs a list of all the current enabled rules.
- **Create config file:** Creates a configuration file template if it doesn't exist.
- **Edit config file:** Opens the configuration file with custom rules, if it exists.
- **Preferences:** Opens the extension settings.

## üîï Marking false positives

While using ASIST Extension, hover over the occurrence and click on `Quick fix...` option, and select `Mark False positive`, This will add the placeholder `asist-ignore-begin` and `asist-ignore-end` comments around the affected line, and fill in the relevant rule ID.

  ![Marking false positive using Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certinia/asist/main/images/marking-false-positives.gif)

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration file

For the VSCode extension to pick up your config file automatically, the file must to be named either `.asist.yaml` or `.asist.json`, and must be located at the root of the workspace.

You can create a configuration file using the `Create config file` command, which produces a self-documented template.

By default, ASIST looks for a config file in the root of the VSCode workspace, but if you like, you can specify a specific config file path (relative to the workspace) in the extension preferences instead -- this can be useful when working with monorepos.

## üëæ Use a custom binary

This extension is shipped with prebuilt ASIST binaries, but if you need to specify a specific ASIST scanner location (which is very useful for developing new features!), here's how:

1. Open the ASIST `Extension settings`
1. Navigate to the `Workspace` tab
2. Enable the `Custom Binary Enabled` setting
3. Provide the path to your ASIST binary in `Custom Binary Path`
